#title: "AICeBlock Guided Tour"
#description: "Welcome to our guided tour, where we present AICeBlock from the perspective of three key roles in a healthcare example, where trust is essential: 
#  Project Manager, Developer, and Auditor. Each video illustrates how the platform supports governance, experimentation, compliance, and efficient auditing in building trustworthy AI solutions.
#
#  In this fictional example, we have an AI solution provider developing a patient referral model based on (simplified) clinical records to support decision-making in the primary care system of a healthcare network.
#  This is a domain where every decision has an impact, demonstrating AICeBlock's potential in supporting development based on best practices, facilitating compliance, and streamlining auditing processes."

  title: "Project Administrator"

    Follow the Project Admin as they create a new project, define user roles, attach the appropriate compliance checklist, 
    and show you the Datasets and Modules dashboards. Assuming a pipeline is ready for deployment, see how the Admin reviews, 
    approves it, and then tests the final model with new patient data to confirm everything's running smoothly.
    Traceable AI Governance made easier.

  title: "Developer"

    Get a behind-the-scenes look at how the Developer creates modules, conducts experiments by using the interactive editor, and deploys the pipeline. 
    You'll see a pipeline execution and how the Developer documents some steps and decisions in the assigned Checklist to 
    ensure the pipeline meets regulatory requirements, prepared for Admin approval. By tracing every artifact in the ML pipeline, development is optimized to minimize errors and facilitate compliance.

  title: "Auditor"
  text: |
    Watch the Auditor verify the actual pipeline and the attached Checklists, with access to the Dataset information and 
    individual code modules for review. Then, they perform a check on integrity of the artifacts, confirming that those handed
    by the providers actually match the ones reported, through a blockchain-kept immutable proof. 
    This role demonstrates how AICeBlock's transparent records and audit trails make it straightforward to ensure integrity and accountability at every stage.
