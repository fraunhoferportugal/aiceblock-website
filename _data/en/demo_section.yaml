  Welcome to our guided tour, where we present AICeBlock from the perspective of three key roles in a healthcare example, where trust is essential: Project Manager, Developer, and Auditor. Each video illustrates how the platform supports governance, experimentation, compliance, and efficient auditing in building trustworthy AI solutions.
  
  In this fictional example, we have an AI solution provider developing a patient referral model based on (simplified) clinical records to support decision-making in the primary care system of a healthcare network. This is a domain where every decision has an impact, demonstrating AICeBlock's potential in supporting development based on best practices, facilitating compliance, and streamlining auditing processes.
