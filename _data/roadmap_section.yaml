    roadmap:
      - title: "ML Project Governance"
        description: >
          Seamlessly manage your machine learning projects, including datasets, modules, experiments, and released pipelines.
          Assign roles to team members, reuse data and code across projects, and even collaborate across organizations—all with built-in governance for traceability and accountability.
      - title: "Compliance Checklists"
        description: >
          Streamline regulatory and standard adherence with predefined or custom checklists.
          These checklists connect directly to deployed pipeline versions, ensuring verifiable transparency and helping organizations meet compliance requirements more easily.
      - title: "Interactive Workflow Editor"
        description: >
          Visualize and edit ML pipelines with our one-of-a-kind Graphical Workflow Builder.
          This tool bridges the gap between technical execution and organizational oversight, enabling non-programmers to
          iterate quickly while maintaining a direct link between visual representations and the actual pipeline code.
      - title: "Verifiable Declarations"
        description: >
          Go beyond self-declaration with blockchain-backed verification. AICeBlock ensures the integrity of datasets, code modules, and other ML artifacts by linking them to
          cryptographic signatures on the blockchain. Auditors can instantly verify authenticity and compliance, making the review process faster, more standardized, and secure.

  - title: "Next"
    subtitle: "Advancing the Compliance Support"
    description: >
      The next step in AICeBlock's journey focuses on expanding our capabilities to simplify compliance,
      enhance privacy, and empower organizations to build AI responsibly with greater confidence. Key features:

    roadmap:
      - title: "Modules for Compliance Support"
        description: >
          Access a growing library of advanced tools to streamline compliance processes and integrate responsible AI practices directly into your pipelines. These modules range Bias analysis
          and mitigation tools, data quality validation techniques, sensitive data detection and anonymization capabilities, robustness tests and an explainability suite.
      - title: "Semi-Automated Checklists"
        description: >
          Save time and reduce errors with intelligent checklists. Map outputs from your pipelines to checklist fields, ensuring real-time, up-to-date documentation for compliance checks.
          These automated links streamline audits and enhance traceability without the need for constant manual updates.
      - title: "Privacy-Preserving ML"
        description: >
          Ensure data security and compliance with privacy-enhancing technologies like Federated Learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, and Differential Privacy to protect
          sensitive information while still enabling valuable insights.\n\nAICeBlock empowers organizations to meet privacy regulations while driving innovation.

  - title: "Beyond"
    subtitle: "Shaping the Future of Trustworthy and Collaborative AI Development"
    description: >
      AICeBlock's visionary roadmap aims to set the tone on AI governance, sustainability, and collaboration. Key features:

      alt: "Radmap beyond section illustration"
    roadmap:
      - title: "ML Copilot"
        description: >
          Imagine an intelligent guide that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical teams — from decision-makers and end-users to developers and auditors — throughout the
          entire lifecycle of an AI solution. AICeBlock's ML Copilot will recommend tailored methodologies based on project scope, data, and pipeline goals; and support
          decision-making during the design, experimentation, and deployment stages.
      - title: "Support for Green AI"
        description: >
          In the pursuit of sustainable AI, AICeBlock envisions tools that help users optimize their pipelines for data and energy efficiency, reducing redundant or unnecessary
          data usage, and minimizing energy consumption, tailored to the infrastructure or hardware where solutions will be deployed. These efforts align with the growing
          demand for eco-conscious AI development, benefiting both the environment and operational costs.
      - title: "Confidential Computing"
        description: >
          Enabling tamper-aware computations ensures organizations can securely perform local computations while maintaining zero-trust principles. With confidential computing
          sensitive operations are protected from unauthorized access, and verifiable declarations remain intact, safeguarding trust and security throughout the process.
      - title: "Fair Collaboration"
        description: >
          Building on the transparent tracing of contributions within ML pipelines, AICeBlock will introduce objective payout parameters for revenue-sharing agreements,
          and transparent reward strategies embedded in smart contracts to fairly distribute value among collaborators. This approach fosters a culture of equitable,
          transparent, and trustworthy collaboration.
